# Road-Accident-Detection
Most of the studies in this field revolve around the enhancement of tangible infrastructure 
rather than on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which include traffic congestion 
detection, accident detection, detecting the occurrence of an event etc. Even the few 
existing studies in the domain lack implementation details and are terrain specific i.e. there 
are constraints both in the geographical as well as demographic aspects. 
In the near future, we focus on developing a “hybrid” wild animal classification framework 
whose automated module working as a recommendation system for the existing citizen 
science-based Wildlife Spotter project.
Efficient and reliable monitoring of wild animals in their natural habitats is essential to 
inform conservation and management decisions. In this paper, using the Wildlife Spotter 
dataset, which contains a large number of images taken by trap cameras in South-central 
Victoria, Australia, we proposed and demonstrated the feasibility of a deep learning 
approach towards constructing scalable automated wildlife monitoring system. Our models 
achieved more than 96% in recognizing images with animals and close to 90% in 
identifying three most common animals (bird, rat and bandicoot). Furthermore, with 
different experimental settings for balanced and imbalanced, the system has shown to be 
robust, stable and suitable for dealing with images captured from the wild. We are working 
on alternative ways to improve the system’s performance by enhancing the dataset, 
applying deeper CNN models and exploiting specific properties of camera trap images. 
Towards a fully automated wild animal recognition system, we would investigate transfer 
learning to deal with problem of highly imbalanced data. In the near future, we focus on 
developing a “hybrid” wild animal classification framework whose automated module 
working as a recommendation system for the existing citizen science-based Wildlife 
Spotter project.
